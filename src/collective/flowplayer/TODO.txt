collective.flowplayer to-do
===========================

    - audio portlet has a lot of blank space
    
Todo and notes to Flowplayer3 version, started at 2009/08/19

STILL WORK IN PROGRESS

   - fix browser tests

   - migration of properties in portal_properties

   - loop does not work. It seems functions are not passed through <object> 
     config params. http://flowplayer.org/forum/6/10931#post-10952

   - initialVolume has to be set using JS as well (same problem as above)
     See http://flowplayer.org/forum/2/11384#post-11528
     
   - some properties seems not directly available in flowplayer3
        usePlayOverlay
        useNativeFullScreen
        controlsOverVideo
        controlBarBackgroundColor
        controlBarGloss
      Some properties may be replaced by custom property of 'controls' plugin, 
      eg property:
        plugins/controls/timeColor with string value '#01DAFF'
